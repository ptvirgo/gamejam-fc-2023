# Making "Stone Soup" for the F- Capitalism Jam 2023

**Wealth is people exercising the desire, and ability to take care of one another.**

A game jam project for the [F- Capitalism](https://itch.io/jam/fuck-capitalism-jam-2023) of June, 2023 on itch.io.

In case you are thinking about trying to help me out: my best guess is that there is no possibility of an *economic system* that isn't ultimately horrible on its own. In slogan terms, I'm guessing that the alternative to capitalism is **democracy.**

But I've never actually seen a real democracy, so what would I know?

Anyway, I want to make something for the jam, and maybe nab a new friend or three in the process.

## Goals

1. Submit a game to the jam before the June 30th 2023 deadline.
2. Do the work such that it doubles as a valuable portfolio addition for myself anyone who helps.
3. Make / strengthen 1 or more friendships.
4. Test out my weird questions (probably need a bit of refining):
    - Can a game jam itself solve real, personal frustrations that are endemic in capitalism?
    - Help my buddy D's career rebuild?
    - My preference to skip the screening process on job interviews?
    - Would it be effective to use "build a game together" as an entrypoint for something like Barbara Sher's "Wishcraft" process?

## Starting with ...

- Web-based, built it Purescript because that's my thing right now.
- Art:
    - Would DRS want to do anything?
    - Draw / photography it myself as option.
- Story based?
- Work out a game mechanic?

- Maybe Harker has some insights from RPG universe?
- Cairn looks interesting for storytelling + RPG mechanics
- Could be some kind of "number goes up, but something goes wrong" clicker.
- SA's grocery bagging job as a story ... ?
- Stone soup as a story?


## Guestimated Schedule

1. Week 1:
    - Mechanism, story, other ideas?
    - Team mates?
1. Week 2: Working proof of concept
1. Week 3: Assets & integration
1. Week 4: Refine & release
